Question:


Two numbers A and B are passed as input. The program must print the odd numbers from A to B (inclusive of A and B)
interlaced with the even numbers from B to A.

Input Format:
The first line denotes the value of A.
The second line denotes the value of B.

Output Format:
The odd and even numbers interlaced, each separated by a space.

Boundary Conditions:
1 <= A <= 9999999
A < B <= 9999999


Example Input/Output 1:

Input:
5
11

Output:
5 10 7 8 9 6 11

Explanation:
The odd numbers from 5 to 11 are 5 7 9 11
The even numbers from 11 to 5 (that is in reverse direction) are 10 8 6
So these numbers are interlaced to produce 5 10 7 8 9 6 11


Example Input/Output 2:

Input:
4
14

Output:
14 5 12 7 10 9 8 11 6 13 4

Explanation:
The odd numbers from 4 to 14 are 5 7 9 11 13
The even numbers from 14 to 4 (that is in reverse direction) are 14 12 10 8 6 4
So these numbers are interlaced to produce 14 5 12 7 10 9 8 11 6 13 4
(Here as the even numbers count are more than the odd numbers count we start with the even number in the output)


Example Input/Output 3:

Input:
3
12

Output:
3 12 5 10 7 8 9 6 11 4

Explanation:
The odd numbers from 3 to 12 are 3 5 7 9 11
The even numbers from 12 to 3 (that is in reverse direction) are 12 10 8 6 4
So these numbers are interlaced to produce 3 12 5 10 7 8 9 6 11 4
